Dirnot "I hate this fucking planet"
"But I currently still have to live on it"
"You know what?"
Dirnot as AngryDirnot "Maybe it's not the planet that sucks"
"Chances are that I'm born in a bad country, where I had to study over 12 hours for 6 years in my best ages, wasting my life."
"I fucking hate Chinese-style education, only wasting lots of people's lives."
"The biggest lesson I learn from such education is desire for liberty and distrust for most people."
"The lucky thing is that my parent, though making me feel not good sometimes, can provide me with a normal environment to live."
"And the luckier thing is that I came across Rita, my wife from the past and to the eternal future."
Drinot "However, I still have to be tortured by the pain of departion and the fucking living conditions of my university."
"Speaking of university, after all those hard work, sweat, anxiety and tears, I got into China's best university, with 1 in 10000 rate."
"And I got admitted into a plan that grants us with the major which we cannot change even before we go to university."
"Without the plan I can have more liberty in major choice, but now I can only stick to an unfamiliar major."
"It turns out that my major, maths, is not really suitable for me after serveral years in university."
Dirnot as SadDirnot "And those good majors are kinda reserved for those who share many more resources from their youth, given by their parents."
"Anyways, those do not really matter now, what I really care about is being with her forever."
"However, life is full of challenges created by jokers."
"Luckily I can go to America for a better future."
"I will earn us a great future with my widsom and efforts, kill all the obstacles lying on the road."
"Morning again..."
