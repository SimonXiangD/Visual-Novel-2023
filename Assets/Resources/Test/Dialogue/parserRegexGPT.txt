# Your task is to give me a regex pattern written in c# based on such input string and output string:

Input:
The given line is in the form of:
"""
function(-s "hello" -a "adfasdf" -c "asdfsadf")
"""

Output:
The results is divided into 2 parts:

part 1. name: function  

part 2. command arguments:
-s "hello"
-a "asfasdf"
-c "asdfsadf"

where:
1. name:
funciton is the name, and it is before the left bracket.


2. command arguments:
There are unlimited groups of command arguments, each group in the form of :
-s + s_content

You need to return part 1 as string, part 2 as list of strings.

Here are some examples.

1. 
Input: 
play(-s "Hello.wav" -v 100)

Output:
play 

-s "Hello.wav"
-v 100

2.
Input:
showSprite(-c "Knight" -f false)

Output:
showSprite

-c "Knight" 
-f false

# After generating the result, give some explanation about the regex pattern
