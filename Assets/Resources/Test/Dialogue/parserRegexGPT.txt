# Your task is to give me a regex pattern written in c# based on such input string and output string:

Input:
The given line is in the form of:
"""
[wait]function(-s "hello" -a "adfasdf" -c "asdfsadf")
"""

Output:
The results is divided into 3 parts:

part 0. prefix: 
wait

part 1. name: 
function  

part 2. command arguments:
-s "hello"
-a "asfasdf"
-c "asdfsadf"

where:
0. prefix
prefix is wrapped in middle brackets and appear before name, this part is optional.

1. name:
funciton is the name, and it is before the left bracket.


2. command arguments:
There are unlimited groups of command arguments, each group in the form of :
-s + s_content

You need to return part 1 as string, part 2 as list of strings.

Here are some examples.

1. 
Input: 
[w]play(-s "Hello.wav" -v 100)

Output:

w

play 

-s "Hello.wav"
-v 100

2.
Input:
showSprite(-c "Knight" -f false)

Output:

None

showSprite

-c "Knight" 
-f false

# After generating the result, give some explanation about the regex pattern. You also need to group the parts with label in regex

^[\[(.*?)\]]?(.*?)\((.*?)\)$
