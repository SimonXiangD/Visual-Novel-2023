# Your task is to give me a regex pattern written in c# based on such input string and output string:

Input:
The given line is in the form of:
"""
speaker "Dialogue" command()
"""

Output:
The results is divided into 3 parts:

speaker
Dialogue
command

where:
1. Speaker:
This part is optional.
This part is purely made of chars and do not contain double quotes.


2. "Dialogue":
This part is optional.
Dialogue is wrapped in ""

3. command:
This part is optional.
This part must contain brackets, and begin with a string like function name.

Here are several examples using the required regex:

1. 
Input: 
Dirnot "Hello, welcome to my second world, 'my stranger friend'. " smile(0, "hello")

Output:
Dirnot
Hello, welcome to my second world, 'my stranger friend'. 
smile(0, "hello")

2.
Input:

Output:

Output:

4.
Input:
